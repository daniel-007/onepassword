/*
Package onepassword provides read-only access to items stored in the 1Password SQLite database.



Compatibility

This package has been tested against a version of 1Password 6 installed from
the App Store. In theory, it should work against any version of 1Password that
uses the OPVault data format to store items in a SQLite database. In practice,
this means versions of 1Password >= 5. YMMV.
